# AI Project Risk Predictor - Starter Bundle

This starter bundle gives you:
- `starter_notebook.py` : a Colab-friendly script that creates a synthetic dataset, trains baseline models (risk classifier + delay regressor), and saves artifacts.
- `streamlit_app.py`  : a simple Streamlit scaffold to demo model predictions.
- `requirements.txt`  : suggested packages.
- This README explains an aggressive 30-day plan and how to run things.

## Quick start (Google Colab)
1. Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Upload `starter_notebook.py` or copy-paste into a new notebook cell.
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   !pip install -q scikit-learn xgboost shap pandas numpy matplotlib joblib streamlit
   ```
4. Run cells sequentially. The script will save `synthetic_projects.csv` and joblib model files.

## Run the demo locally (Streamlit)
1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Ensure `rf_risk_classifier.joblib` and `rf_delay_regressor.joblib` are in this folder (generated by the notebook).
3. Run:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## Timeline summary (aggressive 30-day)
- Week 1: Setup, data acquisition/creation, EDA, feature engineering.
- Week 2: Baseline models, evaluation, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Week 3: Interpretability (SHAP), scenario analysis, build Streamlit demo.
- Week 4: External validation, deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud), report, demo video, GitHub + LinkedIn.

## Resources (free)
- Google Colab
- Kaggle datasets (search for "project" or "software project")
- scikit-learn documentation
- Streamlit docs and community examples
- SHAP library documentation

## Deliverables checklist
- Public GitHub repo with README and code
- Reproducible notebook + synthetic dataset or cleaned real dataset
- Saved models (.joblib)
- Live demo (Streamlit)
- One-page executive summary (PDF)
- 3-minute demo video (screen-recorded)
- LinkedIn post and resume bullet

Good luck — use the aggressive plan if you can commit full days; otherwise extend to 6–8 weeks for higher polish.
